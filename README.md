# Discord Kitten Catcher

Launch main.py with the parameter that you need.

- For Example in the 1st Step:
discord(channel_id, "discord_token", "url_to_grab")

- For Example in the 2nd Step:
ad_link("adlink_url")

It will work on some discords like:
* https://discord.com/invite/gJ8RpPubhG (https://discadia.com/server/nude-leaks/)
* https://discord.gg/Ac8h35jDrY
* https://discord.gg/sjhfU4qsgB

That put all their content (Teen Nudes, Snap Leaks...) on mega.nz folder.
